# Cooking Recipes
The only thing I like more than cooking is to share my cooking. 

Here, I am gonna share the pearls or rather beans of medieval cooking wisdom collected over centuries of oral tradition, passed on to me through my mother, to her through her mother, who would often summarize it as: 

> Cook with love, it comes through in your food.

The list is sorted in the order with most delicious first:

1. [Chinese Fried Rice](chinese-fried-rice.md),
2. [Lasagna](lasagna.md),
3. [Basque Tapas](basque-tapas.md),
4. [Tortilla de Patatas](tortilla-de-patatas.md),
5. [Rice Pudding](rice-pudding.md),
6. [Churros with Chocolate](churros.md),
7. [Khubz](khubz.md)
